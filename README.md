# cobolRayTraceWeekend

A Cobol implementation of the project covered in Ray Tracing in One Weekend by Peter Shirley.

I am using gnuCobol on a macbook pro M3 with pro chip.

This will be an interesting project because Cobol is not an object-oriented language, so I will have to simulate classes and inheritance with data structures and procedural code. There is no inheritnce, no abstract classes, etc., all of which are used in this project. So it will be interesting to see one can implement these concepts in Cobol.

What else I have observed that is a departure from my usual JS/TS and Python coding is that Cobol is very versbose. I would normally divide this code base into many files to keep things organized, but in Cobol I am keeping everything in one file to avoid the overhead of multiple compilation units.

Additionally, COBOL is a compiled language, so there is a compilation step before running the code. Also, Cobol is strongly typed, so all variables must be declared with their types before use.

I am also harnessing Github Copilot with Claude Sonnet 4 as an AI assistant.

View resulting "ppm" images in Preview on Mac. GIMP should work on Linux (and probably on Windows). I am othewise unsure about viewing ppm files on Windows.
